# Introductory information
ZINC and ChEMBL are two important databases in the field of chemistry and drug discovery, but they differ in terms of content and purpose:  
  
**ZINC**:
- **Content**: A database containing millions of commercially available chemical compounds, mainly small molecules. It includes information on chemical structure (e.g., SMILES, SDF), physicochemical properties (e.g., logP, molecular weight), and commercial availability.
- **Purpose**: Primarily used for virtual screening - searching compound libraries to find potential drug candidates. Compounds from ZINC are often used as a starting point for designing new drugs or optimizing existing ones.

**ChEMBL**:
- **Content**: A bioactivity database containing information on chemical compounds, their biological targets (e.g., proteins, enzymes), biological activity (e.g., IC₅₀, Kᵢ), and data from clinical studies.
- **Purpose**: Mainly used for research on structure–activity relationships (SAR), analyzing trends in drug discovery, identifying new biological targets, and validating computational models.

The aim of this project is to predict binding affinity expressed as **pKᵢ**.
