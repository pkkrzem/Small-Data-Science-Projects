# Introductory information
ZINC, ChEMBL and Mordred are three important databases in the field of chemistry and drug discovery, but they differ in terms of content and purpose:  
  
**ZINC**:
- **Content**: A database containing millions of commercially available chemical compounds, mainly small molecules. It includes information on chemical structure (e.g., SMILES, SDF), physicochemical properties (e.g., logP, molecular weight), and commercial availability.
- **Purpose**: Primarily used for virtual screening - searching compound libraries to find potential drug candidates. Compounds from ZINC are often used as a starting point for designing new drugs or optimizing existing ones.

**ChEMBL**:
- **Content**: A bioactivity database containing information on chemical compounds, their biological targets (e.g., proteins, enzymes), biological activity (e.g., IC₅₀, Kᵢ), and data from clinical studies.
- **Purpose**: Mainly used for research on structure–activity relationships (SAR), analyzing trends in drug discovery, identifying new biological targets, and validating computational models.

**Mordred**:
- **Content**: A database of over 1,800 2D and 3D molecular descriptors. These descriptors are numerical values that characterize the properties of molecules, such as their size, shape, and electronic properties.
- **Purpose**: Used to create quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models. These models are used to predict the biological activity of molecules, such as their binding affinity to a protein, based on their chemical structure.

The aim of this project is to predict binding affinity expressed as **pKᵢ**.
